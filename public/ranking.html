<h1>The Best Movies According to Anna-Maria</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
<p>A political movie dressed as a fairytale. Actually, it is a cinematic masterpiece against fascism, both horrifying and visually appealing</p>
<h3>The Color of Pomegranates</h3>
<p>Symbolic, philosophical, visually bombastic, it narrates the life of the poet Sayat Nova, as perceived by the director.</p>
<h3>Whisper of the Heart</h3>
<p>The purest love story between two kids with great aspirations and dreams. I'm not crying, you are crying.</p>
